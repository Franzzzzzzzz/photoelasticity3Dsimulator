- Implementation of continuous ray matrix multiplication, instead of actual propagation. The propagation can be lest as a last step, which would allow changing the incoming polarisation on the fly. 
- Implement full image save of the ray propagation
- Keyboard shortcuts. 
- Multiple ray color
- tetrahedron to ray interesection (Eigen)
  - Faster: use connectivity list
    - Get connectivity from mesh
      => Very slow, not sure if there would be a better way to do it, couldn't get cell arrays to work.
    - check intersection Ray-Boundary tetras
    - Once found, check interesection with adjacent tetras and repeat. 
    
    => Current problem, a ray at the boundary could go through several boundary tetras ...Need to refine the handling of boundaries.
