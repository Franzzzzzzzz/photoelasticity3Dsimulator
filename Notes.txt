from P. S. Theocaris et al., Matrix Theory of Photoelasticity
This would be with ray_stokes
=> ray.get_photoelastic_deltas(stress, ds) ; 
=> ray.get _photoelastic_dphis(stress) ;
NB: the projections is along the principle axis of the stress, which is not very good for us.

Better approach, effectively using Jones calculus. Use equations (13).
